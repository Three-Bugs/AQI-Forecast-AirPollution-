#  AQI Forecast for cities in India
This repository has a forecast of Air Quality Index(AQI) of cities in India, to measure the level of air pollution. A citizen can go through the forecast and can avoid going out on days when the AQI level is dangerous to the health. We also suggest various measures a citizen can take to reduce down the AQI level. This forecast has been integrated with an android app. The app also has a blog on environment protection. We have considered these cities as of now: Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. 

This project was done as a part of Hackference Hackathon in 20 hours, which was sponsored by Google, GitHub, Mozilla, DigitalOcean, and many others. It was an effort to help a bit to fight the recent rise of air pollution in Delhi.
